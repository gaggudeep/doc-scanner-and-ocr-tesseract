# Doc Scanner + OCR(Tesseract) using OpenCV
In this project I have used OpenCV to create a module which transforms a raw document image into a space-filled image of the same document which can be used for further applications like text recognition. Moreover, in another module I have created a text recognizer using Google's Tesseract. Functionality of both of these modules can be used together by making some modifications as described in the code file 'text_recognition.py'.
